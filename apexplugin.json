   "description": "Free Plug-in under MIT License, which means it is free for everyone to use, no matter if for commercial or private use. The UC Text Snippet Expand dynamic action plug-in extends one or multiple input fields to listen for entered shortcuts (e.g. lol) and immediately expands them to a long version (e.g. laughing out loud). This is similar to an auto-correct functionality. This plug-in works on Text Fields, Text Areas, and CKEditor4 fields, as well as in  Interactive Grids. Shortcuts and their expanded text are provided as a query. Additionally, you can also define stop-characters for a shortcut, that's the key after which a shortcut is evaluated. Default is space, period, comma, question mark, exclamation mark.",
