# Text Snippet Expand

Plug-in for Oracle Application Express (APEX) by United Codes Plug-ins Pro

Free Plug-in under MIT License, which means it is free for everyone to use, whether for commercial or private use. The UC Text Snippet Expand dynamic action plug-in extends one or multiple input fields to listen for entered shortcuts (e.g., lol) and immediately expands them to a long version (e.g., laughing out loud). This is similar to an auto-correct functionality. This plug-in works on Text Fields, Text Areas, and CKEditor4 fields, as well as Interactive Grids. Shortcuts and their expanded text are provided as a query. You can also define stop-characters for a shortcut, which is the key after which a shortcut is evaluated. The defaults are space, period, commas, question marks, and exclamation marks.
